<h2>JAvaScript이란 무엇인가</h2><p>JavaScript (1" 'd3a va,skrxpt/),
  [6] often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming
  language. It is a language which is also characterized as dynamic, weakly
  typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm. Alongside HTML and css,
  JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web.
  [7] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential
  part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it,[8]
  and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to
  execute it.</p>
